## Discussion

Discuss the issues and successes you encountered during programming
(development). Here are some questions to get you started. You don't
have to answer all of them in order - they are a guideline to get you
thinking.
  * What problems did you have? What went well?
  * What process did you go through to create the program?
  * What did you have to research and learn on your own?
  * What kinds of errors did you get? How did you fix them?
  * What parts of the project did you find challenging?
  * Is there anything that finally "clicked" for you in the process 
  of working on this project?
  * Is there anything that you would change about the project?
  * Can you apply what you learned in this project to future projects?

## Testing

We have three test classes. They use JUnit 4. They are:
- UserTest.java for User.java
- UserListTest.java for UserList.java
- Team9GUITest.java for Team9GUI.java
Details about them are in our backlog.
All of our products pass all of our test cases.
