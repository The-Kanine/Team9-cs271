Tuan & Van README

1. User.java
New external variables: answer
New methods: getAnswer(), setAnswer(), matchAnswer(), and isAuthentic()

2. UserTest.java
New method: testSecurityQuestion()
Changes to testNewAccount()

3. UserList.java
New methods: doesUserNameExist2(), doesEmailExist2(), findUserIndex(), findUserIndex2(),getUserAtIndex(),
and setUserAtIndex()

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Please use!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
getUserAtIndex() and setUserAtIndex()
findUserIndex() for criteria 2.4
doesUserNameExist2() for criteria 3.4
doesEmailExist2() for criteria 3.5
findUserIndex2() for criteria 5.6

We're going to operate on indices.
The steps are:

1. Find the user of interest's index
Ex (after a valid login): int index = findUserIndex(userLogIn.getText(), new String(passwordLogIn.getPassword()));

2. Assign the user at that index to a new User object
Ex: User user = list.getUserAtIndex(index);

3. Make changes to that new User object 
Ex (after the user editted their username): user.setUserName(userNameEdit.getText());

4. Set the original user to the new User object (setUserAtIndex()).
Ex: list.setUserAtIndex(index, user);

So we cannot lose the original user's index at any point.

4. UserListTest.java
No new method. Changes to current methods (tests for new UserList methods).

5. New test classes               ***PLEASE READ!***
- Above each test case, we put what the expected (pop-up) message should be. We also put the acceptance criteria
number there (Edit, forgotUName & forgotPass).
- Each test case is independent now. You can comment out the test cases that you don't need.
- We have also updated the acceptance criteria for story 3, 4, and 5. So if you are confused about the design,
you can check the spreadsheet.
- You have to name the buttons and text fields to what we have below or the test class will always have errors
and wonâ€™t run.
